    <h2>You clicked Keyboard</h2>
    A computer keyboard is a typewriter-style device <br/>
    which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as mechanical levers or <br/>
    electronic switches. Following the decline of punch cards <br/>
     and paper tape, interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards <br/>
      became the main input method for computers.
